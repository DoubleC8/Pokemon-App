# Pokemon-App
 In this project, I created an app that lets users search for Pokémon by name or ID and view detailed information and images. Using freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy, I integrated Pokémon data into a user-friendly interface, enhancing my skills in API integration and front-end development while crafting a fun tool for Pokémon fans.
